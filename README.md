# Network Security MLOps Project

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** designed to detect and respond to network security threats efficiently. I started building and learning this pipeline about a month ago to deepen my understanding of combining machine learning with operational best practices.

## Project Highlights

* **Automated Data Ingestion**
  Data is ingested directly from a MongoDB database, ensuring smooth and continuous data flow into the pipeline.

* **Data Validation and Transformation**
  Rigorous data validation steps check for data quality and drift, while transformation components prepare features suitable for model training.

* **Model Training and Evaluation**
  The pipeline includes modular components for training machine learning models and evaluating their performance on unseen data to ensure robustness.

* **Model Pushing**
  An automated model pusher component manages deployment readiness by packaging and storing the trained models.

* **Artifact Management**
  Outputs of each pipeline stage (like transformed data files, validation reports, feature stores, and trained model files) are systematically stored in the `Artifact` folder for easy tracking and reproducibility.

* **MLflow Integration**
  The entire project is tracked with MLflow, allowing experiment logging, performance monitoring, and version control for models.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)
3. Configure environment variables in `.env`
4. Run the training pipeline using:

   ```bash
   python networksecurity/pipeline/training_pipeline.py
   ```
5. Use MLflow UI to track experiments:

   ```bash
   mlflow ui
   ```

## What’s Next

* Containerize the project with Docker for easy deployment.
* Implement a deployment layer for serving the model via API.
* Add monitoring and alerting for production use cases.
